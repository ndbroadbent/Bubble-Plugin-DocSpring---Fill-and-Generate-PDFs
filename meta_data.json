    "plugin_instructions": "This plugin provides an API integration for DocSpring. Sign up for a free trial at: https://docspring.com\n\n1. Create an API token in DocSpring. Set your API Token ID and Secret in the Plugins tab.\n2. Create a template in DocSpring. (Setting all field types to \"text\" may help you avoid any unnecessary errors.)\n3. Enable \"Allow Additional Properties in JSON Data\" in your template's Settings.\n4. Use the \"DocSpring - Create PDF Submission\" action in Workflows > Plugins to generate a PDF.\n5. The \"PDF File\" property will be available as a \"Result of Step X\" property. This is the download URL of the file.\n\nIMPORTANT: \"PDF File\" is a *temporary* URL that is only valid for 60 minutes. Please make sure that you use Bubble's \":saved to S3\" option so that Bubble will download the PDF and store it (see our demo app for an example.) If you don't use \"PDF File:saved to S3\", then you won't be able to access your PDF after 60 minutes.\n\n- You can change the name of the PDF file by setting the \"pdf_filename\" key under the metadata option. (You don't need to include .pdf at the end.) See our API documentation for more information: https://docspring.com/docs/api/generate_pdf.html\n\n\nSending Images\n------------------------------------\n\nIf your PDF template has an image field, you can send an image as a URL or a base64-encoded string. You will need to append \"/url\" or \"/base64\" to the image field's name when you are setting up your Create PDF Submission call.\n\nFor example, if you have an image field named \"image\" and you want to use an image from a URL, you can use \"image/url\" as the key for your Data, and enter a URL in the value field.\n\n\nFeedback\n------------------------------------\n\nPlease let us know about any bugs and issues at: bubble@docspring.com\n\n\nFurther Assistance\n------------------------------------\n\nIf you need help building your Bubble app, you can reach out to Copilot (https://withcopilot.com). They are Bubble experts who worked on the original \"PDF Filler\" plugin for DocSpring. Send an email to: plugins@withcopilot.com",
